# Create Table Definition Streamlt app for Keboola Users

This simple streamlt app allows [Keboola](www.keboola.com) users to define native datatype tables via richer interface.   
Native Datatype tables are defined via [this API call](https://keboola.docs.apiary.io/#reference/tables/create-table-definition/create-new-table-definition), and the creation of them has yet to receive support in a standard storage UI.

Please mind this code does not do validation of the datatype definition.   
If you are interested to alter it please send a pull request.
